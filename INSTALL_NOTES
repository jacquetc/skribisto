Plume Creator was developed with Qt Creator 2.5.2 on Linux Mint 14 "Nadia" 64bit KDE using Qt 4.8.3 libraries.

Moreover, I use Qt Creator 2.7.2 with Qt 5.1 libraries on Microsoft Windows 7

The simplest way to try it is to open it as project in Qt Creator, then execute it.

		On Linux :

	To compile it, you need :

g++
make
qmake
libqt4-dev
libzip-dev
libhunspell-dev


To run it :

libqt4-core
libqt4-gui
libqt4-network
libzip
libhunspell



		On Windows :
		
	To compile it :
	
Have in "include" folder of Qt :
zconf.h
zlib.h

Have in "lib" folder of Qt :
zdll.lib

	To run it :
	
Have in "bin" folder of Qt or in the target folder of the .exe :
zlib1.dll
